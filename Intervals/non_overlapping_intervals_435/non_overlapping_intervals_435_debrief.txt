1. This was my first interval problem, so I'm not terribly upset about not finding the solution since I didn't have the intuition yet and can't be bothered to spend the time to develop it individually. 
2. Basic pattern is to sort the intervals, either lexicographically, or acording to the end position, then whenever an interval overlaps, remove the element that ends later. 
3. This works because by keeping the intervals that ends sooner, we are always minimizing the potential for a future interval collision. That's where the greedy choice property comes in on this problem.
