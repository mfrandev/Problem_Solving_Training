1. This was not great. I immediately pidgon-holed myself into a complicated solution by sorting w.r.t. the endpoint, rather than the start point. 
2. Ultmiately did figure out the solution though, so that's good.
3. Takeaway is to consider what the goal of sorting is. "What is our algorithm?"

Result: 6/10 (min score for a solve w/o help).
