1. This is Prim's Algorithm.
2. Problem could also be implemented using Kruskal's algorithm (Union Find).
3. This is a problem worth studying. I don't expect you to come up with this, but I expect you to learn it well and understand why it has optimal substructure and why the greedy choice property applies.
