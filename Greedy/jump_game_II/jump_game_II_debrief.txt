1. I will give you a little bit of grace with this one. You've never been good at Greedy problems, but that's going to change. 
2. You made many of the key observations, but had no idea how to set up the greedy invariant maintenance.
3. You also overcomplicated the problem a bit. These solutions should actuall be quite simple, unless we can demonstrate a clear need for implementational complexity.
4. Overall a good learning experience, but I need to see improvement quickly.
Result: 5/10
