1. Missed two of the three key observations. 
2. Obs 1: if sum(cost) > sum(gas), then there is no solution. Otherwise, there is a guaranteed solution.
3. If problem does not guarantee a solution, should ask "in which conditions are there no solutions?"
4. Obs 2: If there is a solution, it is unique. Thus, the first possible solution (when iterating from left-to-right) is the answer.
