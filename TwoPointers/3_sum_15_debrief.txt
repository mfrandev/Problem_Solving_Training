1. Got far too focused on an optimal solution that doesn't exist. First, focus on finding the solution if the optimal complexity class isn't obvious.
2. For that reason, did not consider sorting the input array.
3. After sorting the input array, failed to notice that incrementing i, j by one after finding a valid solution produces duplicates. Solution requires implementing these indices by however many values until a new value is found.
