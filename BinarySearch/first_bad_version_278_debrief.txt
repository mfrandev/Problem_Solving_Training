1. I understood the problem and how the statement defines the monotonic relationship among the input.
2. Completing this problem taught me how the generic binary search template is correctly applied, particularly w.r.t. updating l, r indices.
3. To put it explicitly, it doesn't matter how the condition function is phrased, but if left is being modified, it will allways be mid + 1 if l < r is the looping condition.
