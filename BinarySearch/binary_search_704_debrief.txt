1. Completely forgot the relationship between the binary search condition and "l" at the time of search completion. 
2. Forgot how to modify l and r, w.r.t the condition. It should be l < r, if a[m] < target, then l = l + 1. Otherwise r = m.
3. At the time of search termination, 'l' value is the 'i'th smallest element which satisifes the condition function. 
4. The the "condition function" is the determinant of whether the 'i'th element is "smaller" or "larger" than our target.
5. In other words, the condition function is how we define and act on the monotonic properties of the input.
