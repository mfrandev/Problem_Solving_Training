1. First mistake was not reading the problem statement closely enough. Missed the key detail that digits are in reverse order. I.e., first node of list is least significant digit.
2. Noticed that since this is a linked list problem, a stack could be really helpful.
3. I didn't originally consier that non-zero carry has to be added to the solution after addition completes.
4. Failed to construct the results list top-down and returning from a dummy node. Needed to add all values to a stack, and build the results set bottom-up.
Result: 6/10, problem solved.
