1. Well done. Intuitively identified that this is a stack problem almost immediately. 
2. The solution you came up with made sense, you wrote the process out in english at the top of the file too.
3. The only thing you forgot to vocalize, but did think about, is if the first element of the list is the one to be removed.
4. Variables were clearly defined, so you knew well what was what.
