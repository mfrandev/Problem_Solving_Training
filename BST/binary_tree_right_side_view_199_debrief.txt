1. Really well done. You've seen the problem a long time ago, but immediately recognized the solution and the type of traversal that needed to be performed. This solution was definitely not memorized.
2. Passed on the first go, implementation felt natural too. That's not something I say often, or lightly. Well done.
Result: 10/10
