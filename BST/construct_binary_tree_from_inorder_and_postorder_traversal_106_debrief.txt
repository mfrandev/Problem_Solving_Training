1. Good job re-doing this. You did sort of memorize the solution observations, but the implementation was clear based on the observations.
2. You didn't memorize the code and skip the "why is it working" part.
3. Pattern seeming to emerge in recusion algorithms where I am neglecting the bookkeeping process in base case processing.
