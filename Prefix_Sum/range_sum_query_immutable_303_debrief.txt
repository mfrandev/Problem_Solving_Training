1. Recognised the prefix sum technique from the question. I.e., Sum of elements from i to j in an array.
2. Did not handle the "left-1 < 0" case correctly from the start. Instead of subtracting 0, I subtracted nums[0], which was wrong. 
3. Reminder to be careful with python class accesses. Always make sure to use the "self" modifier when accessing class variables, except in the "setter" case in the constructor, where "self.data = data"
4. Initially had an extra variable "sum" used to compute prefix sums. That was really silly, because I should have simply used the previous prefix sum. The setup is tabulation-like.
