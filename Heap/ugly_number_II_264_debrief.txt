1. This problem did not go well. I had no idea how exactly to integrate the queue into the solution, largely because I failed to recognize how the problem space grew. 
2. I got stuck at figuring what the next ugly numbers were.
3. I did successfully identify the base case, that 1 is an ugly number. 
4. I did not consider that the nth value is indexed as n-1.
5. Did not initially consider using the "visited" set to prevent duplicates, but as this is effectively a kind of BFS graph problem that makes a lot of sense.
