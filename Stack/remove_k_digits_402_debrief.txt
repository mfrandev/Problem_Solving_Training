This was a pretty difficult question. I made many of the key observations, like generally biasing smaller numbers over bigger ones, but I didn't consider controlling the value of K to make the array/stack monotonically increasing. Again, I overcomplicated this jawn and needed to go to papa neetcode to get the answer. All in all, there were valid thoughts had here, but couldn't get the answer. Maybe next time.
