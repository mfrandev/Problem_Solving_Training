1. Most important detail here is that state is defined as the tuple [(index, goalpost)].
1a. Need to learn how this is hashed in python.
2. Recurrence relation is from a given (index, goalpost), to check how many ways to reach goalpost if adding this value, and how many if subtracting this value.
3. Base cases are standard memo case, if index == end, goalpost == target, 1, else if done, then 0.
