1. Check if the length of the tabulation table needs to be n + 1 because of 0-based indexing. 
2. All tabulation involves is formally defining a sequence and relationship between states within that sequence (recurrence relation).
3. Tabulation is called "Bottom Up" Dynamic Programming.
4. Is it possible that the states in the sequence might be related to the indices of the table itself ? 
5.
