1. This solution is beautiful and I did not get it.
2. It is a collection of policies (invariants) generated by clever observations regarding the relationship between the r and l pointers of the fixed window and the length of the q struture.
3. We organize the q s.t. the element at q[0] is the index of the smallest element in the nums window indexed with (r - l + 1).
4. Note that the length of the q DOES NOT NEED TO EQUAL THE WINDOW SIZE. The values in the queue simply preserve information about the elements we've processed thus far in that window.
5. That is why we do not update l pointer every iteration. Only when (r-l+1) >= k.
